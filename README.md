# PFAS Adsorbent Search

## Setup

### For fetching the data

#### Installing the required packages
conda env create -f environment.yaml

conda activate pfas

#### Updating the environment.yaml files

conda env update -f environment.yml --prune

## Scripts 

### Running the script to fetch data
Fetch the data from the PACE ICE cluster from the directory `/storage/ice-shared/cs8903onl/mussmann-pfas/data/` and copied into the `data/` directory.

```
cd pfas-environment-cleanup
python3 scripts/fetch_data.py
```
## DFT Calculation Process

### Quantum Espresso Input Production
An automated pipeline for automatically converting a compound of interest into a Quantum Espresso input is in development, but this is the manual process for the time being. 
1. Using [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), find the SMILES format of the compound of interest.
2. Using [OpenBabel](https://openbabel.org/index.html), convert the SMILES string into an MDL Molfile (.mol).
3. Using [VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/), convert the MDL Molfile into a Crystallographic Information File (.cif), inputting and modifying crystal orientations/morphologies as necessary. 
4. Using [cif2cell](https://pypi.org/project/cif2cell/), convert the Crystallographic Information File into a Quantum Espresso input file (.in).
5. Modify the input file with pseudopotentials for constituent atoms and standard run parameters based on those atoms.
6. Run PWSCF simulation with input file via [Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/INPUT_PW.html) (pw.x). 
Note: This method represents a slight workaround from the typical DFT calculation process designed around VASP POSCAR files, used with VASP instead of Quantum Espresso. It is possible that some information is lost or improperly assumed in this conversion process, particularly at the .mol to .cif file conversion step with VESTA.
